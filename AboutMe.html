                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p> I was given the name Zairen, born on January 02, 2005, in Baguio City, Benguet, and never left. I have two siblings, Jan Carsten Sven and Shaireen Anne, both born on February 14 but with an 11-year gap and I am my parents' most humorous offspring and of course, the middle child. I have always questioned my parents for giving my siblings long names while I only have one, but I am grateful that I did not have to write such a long name on my papers every time. They said that they were planning to name me Ryzen because they thought I was going to be a boy and how funny it is that Ryzen is one of Advance Micro Devices' leading microprocessors and now I'm an IT student.

                    I attended both Saint Vincent De Ferrer Learning Center and the University of the Cordilleras in Elementary and graduated from Saint Louis School, INC. in Junior and Senior high school.  I am currently attending the University of the Cordilleras as a student of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology major in Web Technologies. If you asked me why is this my chosen program, I would make fun of how this was the result when I placed all of my options on a picker wheel, but the truth is BSIT was not my first option. I graduated high school thinking about how I would pursue Civil Engineering because of my interest in Mathematics and Physics. I chose this program because of the emerging and constant development of Information Technology. As a perfectionist myself, I wanted to improve my skills even further simultaneously with the current trends in technology. And my long-term goal is to be a software engineer or web developer.
